Purpose: The POST method is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. When a client sends a POST request, it often includes data in the body of the request.
Characteristics:
Data sent with a POST request is included in the body of the request, not in the URL.
It is not idempotent (submitting the same request multiple times can create multiple resources).
POST requests are not cached, and they cannot be bookmarked.
Common Use Cases: Submitting forms, creating new resources, and sending data to the server.
