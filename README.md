# POST-Method
The POST method is used in web development to send data from the client (frontend) to the server (backend) for storage or processing. In a full-stack application, this typically involves a user filling out a form or providing input, which is then transmitted via a POST request.

How it works:

User Input: The user enters information into a form on the webpage.
Sending Data: When the user submits the form, the frontend sends an HTTP POST request to the backend server, including the input data.
Processing Data: The server receives this data, processes it (e.g., validates, saves it to a database), and responds with a success message or the newly created resource.
Updating UI: The frontend updates the webpage to reflect the new data, such as adding the new item to a list.
In summary:
The POST method enables users to add or submit data to a web application, allowing dynamic interaction and data management in full-stack development.
